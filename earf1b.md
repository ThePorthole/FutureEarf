# Chapter 1 Prologue: The Return

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | It's been a long walk.  Your clothes are dusty.  The bottom of your feet are covered in ash that used to be people. That used to be an entire town.  A town you don't even know the name of.  <br /><br />You're getting closer to town now and you can see it.  But you can also see other people walking into town.  In groups.  Nelly has perked up for the first time since the bomb went off.  He's curious.<br /><br />"What's going on?"<br /><br />You're met at the town gates by members of the All-Stars who have set up a checkpoint and are screening people as they come in.  You recognize Spark, the guy who built the piece for the radio.<br /><br />"Hey guys, come right over here!"<br /><br />He ushers you through and you're in town.  But it's different now.  Bustling.  People walking around. Excitement is in the air.  Shops that had been shuttered are open and doing business.  Spark leads you through town to the All-Stars HQ.  Inside you see Michael.<br /><br />"Well, if it isn't the reason for the season!"  He announces.<br /><br />"What's going on? Who are all these people?" asks Nelly.<br /><br />"They're survivors.  All of them.  When you guys fixed the radio, our transmission reached further out and people heard us.  And they came.  They had materials.  Skills.  We've got new shops in town. We're building up our defenses. We're restocking our supplies.  It's amazing."<br /><br />And then his voice lowers.  <br /><br />"They've also come with stories.  There was another town? Full of survivors?"<br /><br />Nelly drops his head.<br /><br />"Look.  I'm not here to judge.  I'm sure you did what you had to do.  Let's just try to make sure it doesn't happen again."<br /><br />He hands each of you a sack with 15GP in it. <br /><br />"For your troubles."  <br /><br />He also hands you a jacket with an "All-Stars" patch on it.  <br /><br />"You're one of the team now.  Welcome aboard.  We've got a lot of work to do, but you boys look tired.  Go into town and re-supply and get some rest."  We've got a big day tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />YOU'VE UNLOCKED "THE CANTEEN" AND NEW SUPPLIES.  YOU'VE ALSO UPGRADED THE DEFENSES FOR THE TOWN.  THEY'LL BE ABLE TO PUSH BACK STRONGER ATTACKS FROM "THE ARRIVED."  AS THE TOWN GROWS SO WILL ITS SUPPLIES, DEFENSES, AND ECONOMY.  IT WILL ALSO ADD CHARACTERS.  <br /><br />YOU ARE NOW LEVEL 2.
