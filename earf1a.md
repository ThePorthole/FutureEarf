# Chapter 1: So You Think You Can Die

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | It's pitch black. And cold. Very cold. You try to walk and kick something. Wait, you are on your back.<br /><br />Oh God, you are trapped in a box!<br /><br />You kick and punch and scream. The wood is soft and you break through. Something is on your face. Bugs. Dirt. The box if filling with dirt! You can't see anything but you can feel it starting to fill the box behind your neck.<br /><br />You've got to get out of here.<br /><br />You punch through the dirt, pushing your hand through the hole in the box. The dirt is soft, so you make quick work and soon you are up on your knees, digging furiously above your head. You have to get out of here before you suffocate. You can hear mumbling. Hopefully you are digging in the right direction.<br /><br />Then your finger is snagged on something. Something is in the dirt. You rip through it, but it's tougher going now. Much tougher. You push with your legs with all you've got. Your fingers feel air. And grass. You keep pushing through. The mumbles turn to screams.<br /><br />You finally break through with your head and shake off the dirt. Your shoulders break through shortly after. As your eyes adjust you see two people running away. Maybe 50 yards away now. Screaming.<br /><br />About 8 feet in front of you is a young man. Maybe 15. He is holding what looks to be a mangled arm. It looks weird, even for a mangled arm. You haven't stopped pulling yourself out of the dirt. One leg. Then another.<br /><br />The kid is talking but you don't understand. Maybe chanting. You look around and see several other people emerging from the dirt. As they stand, the boy stops chanting. Or talking. Or whatever he's doing.<br /><br />You are trying to get your bearings about you. Your eyes adjust. Your ears adjust. You have no idea what the fuck is going on. |

I was in a fight with a man and some pyrotechnics - I thought I had gotten the best of him, and next thing you know I'm here! Wow, what a wild ride. |
| ![Homer](https://i.imgur.com/N2VsADDb.png)<br>Homer | I was at a concert I was putting on<br /><br />Which in and of itself is kinda weird since I am a teller of epic tales, but that is besides the point. I was a concert where I was the main bard, and some gigantic guy comes in and kills this groupie I was about to have sex with, which was definitely very uncool of him, and then next thing I know he slits my throat and I end up here<br /><br />Crazed fans, what can you do, amiright? |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Nelly is nervous but in awe of you. He stands mouth agape. <br /><br />Then you hear it. You look to your right and there is an angry mob headed your way. They are being led by the two young men you saw retreating as you dug yourself up. <br /><br />"Ah shit guys, this isn't good. Let's get out of here. Follow me!"<br /><br />Nelly takes off towards the woods. |
| ![Ondee Awtherham](https://i.imgur.com/35ksE1pb.png)<br>Ondee Awtherham | Admiring Nelly's country grammer, I follow. |

| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | Follow in Nelly's footsteps |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You bound through the woods.  You follow Nelly and you can tell that grew up near these woods.  He's making moves and ducking under fallen trees with such speed and precision, that it's practically instinct.  <br /><br />You have to give it your all to keep up.  You can hear the mob behind you, but it seems they are getting farther and father away.  <br /><br />You come to a very small clearing.  Nelly stops and listens.<br /><br />THROUGH THIS ACTION, YOU HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF. YOUR SPEED.  PLEASE CHECK YOUR CHARACTER THREAD IN YOUR PF TO SEE THE RESULTS.<br /><br />"Okay, I think we're good."<br /><br />  Nelly exits the clearing on the other side and you are standing on a hill.  Below is a small cottage.  You head down and Nelly knocks on the door.  An older man answers.  <br /><br />"Nelly, what are you doing here this time of night?  It's late"<br /><br />"Sorry, I kind of need your help."<br /><br />The old man looks at you suspiciously, but allows you in.<br /><br />"What's this about?"<br /><br />Nelly looks nervous, but continues.<br /><br />"Well, I found a Reacher.  He was in some sort of accident with his craft I think.  He was deadd when I found him.  I saw his arm lying there. And it had that wave of energy look over it   So I picked it up."<br /><br />"You stupid boy, what have you done?"<br /><br />"Well, I'd heard how they can raise the deadd to be a slave army for them.  And I thought, maybe I could...."<br /><br />The old man looks at you.  Nervous now.<br /><br />"Boy, you better not have bought trouble to my house."<br /><br />"But I don't think I did it right, because they aren't like the ones Reachers bring back. These guys are like...normal."<br /><br />The old man is curious now.<br /><br />"Who are you guys?" |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | "Well, you boys seem confused.  I'm Ben Rice.  Just an old man and friend of Nelly here."<br /><br />"Ben, they died in 2017.  The year of the beginning."<br /><br />"Oh ho ho!  You boys have a lot of catching up to do.  A lot's changed since you've been gone.  In 2017, Earth was attacked.  A race from another planet invaded.  Aliens I guess.  This small town is the last holdout of humanity.  Although, maybe not for long."<br /><br />"What's going on Ben?"<br /><br />"The All-Stars and the Mon-stars are getting a bit more irritable lately."<br /><br />Nelly turns to you.<br /><br />"The All-Stars and the Mon-stars are two rival factions in town.  They both think they have the right way of protecting the town and keeping it safe."<br /><br />Ben looks at you all.<br /><br />"I'd recommend you boys go and visit with one of them and see if you can lend them a hand.  It's been real hairy around here lately."<br /><br />Nelly looks kind of excited.<br /><br />"Which one should we go to guys?  The All-Stars downtown or the Mon-Stars uptown?" |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | Uptown mon<br />he's been living in his uptown world<br />I bet he's never had a backstreet homer<br />I bet his momma never told him why |

| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | I'm up for either. Nelly, do you have a recommendation? What's the difference between these groups other than their location? |
| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | Sup guys. I'm a druid from the old days. I grow marijuana. Then use the hemp as a superwoman whip. |
| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | Yea what's the difference between the two groups<br />#cast a truth spell |
| ![Nelly Nunchucks](https://i.imgur.com/ZnFK2nNb.png)<br>Nelly Nunchucks | Meh, they're both just glorified militia tbh.  They can be kind of jerks to kids, but for the most part they do keep us safe.  They fight every once in a while, but nothing too big.  But Ben seems to think something's brewing.  Flip of a coin if ya ask me. |
| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | Let's check out the all-stars. They sound friendliest |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | "Not a problem.  Let's go." says Nelly.<br /><br />Ben interrupts. <br /><br />"Well, you boys are going to need some equipment before you just go running off and joining a militia."<br /><br />He hands you a backpack.<br /><br />YOUR CHARACTER HAS BEEN UPDATED.  PLEASE CHECK FOR YOUR PF.<br /><br />Nelly grabs a bag as well and heads out the door.  You follow him as he treks through the woods into town.<br /><br />"I'm not going to lie to you guys, I'm a little nervous.  I've never really joined a militia because I've never even been in a fight before.  I mean, you guys look strong and all, but I'm just a kid.  Do you guys promise to stay close and not leave me out there?"<br /><br />About that time you arrive at a checkpoint.  Three men stand armed with patches that say "All-Stars."  Simple enough.  <br /><br />"We're here to meet with you guys about any help you might need."<br /><br />"Take 'em to Michael," one of them says.  <br /><br />Another soldier you didn't see comes out and motions for you to follow.  Nelly looks at you guys nervously, but you follow the man.  <br /><br />You move throughout the town. It is old and fortified.  And a little ragged. You arrive at the tavern and are guided upstairs.  A man sits at a table surrounded by other soldiers.<br /><br />"Michael, these guys want to join up."<br /><br />"Is that so?  Did you check to see if they are Mon-Star spies?!"<br /><br />"I'm not sure how I would even do that," replies the soldier.<br /><br />"Fair enough.  Let's put them on a test mission.  'The Arrived' are closing in our location.  So if we don't get backup soon, we're done for.  There's a radio tower about 20miles outside town.  It's broken, but Spark here has rigged a solution.  Carry it to the radio tower, hook it up, and we should be able to alert other survivors where to come and see if there are any other holdouts out there.  Deal?"<br /><br />Nelly looks at you. |
| ![Gingerbardman](https://i.imgur.com/Pc267pkb.png)<br>Gingerbardman | What did I miss? |
| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | *nodding yes* I'll agree. Who are the arrived? Another militia? What's happened in this world? I've been having visions of dying...I have so manny questions. Perhaps someone can help me answer them if we help you? |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Michael looks at Jwill strangely. <br /><br />Nelly laughs nervously.<br /><br />"Ha! These guys are jokers alright!"  *He glares at Jwill.  <br /><br />"Don't let the jokes fool ya though.  We are tough. We can handle your test mission."<br /><br />"Good. Lawrence will lead you out back. There is a wagon there with the attachment you'll take to the radio tower. Just clip it to the base of the tower and return."<br /><br />Lawrence leads you to the wagon. "There's room for 2 in the front the rest can sit in the back."<br /><br />Nelly jumps up to the drivers seat. <br /><br />Where will you sit? |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | i mean no, fuck the monstars.  i ain't no spy.  let's hook up a radio! |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | Kickin' in the front seat<br />Sittin' in the back seat<br />Gotta make my mind up<br />Which seat can I take?<br /><br />let's go middle back between the two awks trying to dance |

| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | I'll sit on the back facing backwards. Keeping an eye out |
| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | Good idea chappie. I'll be sure to keep my eyes trained on the road ahead. No surprises. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You pile into the wagon and Nelly begins driving out of town. <br /><br />"This is my first time leaving town. It's kind of exciting."<br /><br />"Also, Jwill it's probably best that we don't let people know you've been raised from the deadd. People are really superstitious and I'd likely get into a lot of trouble."<br /><br />Just then the horses stop. There are three barrels in the middle of the road. <br /><br />"Hmm, that's strange." |
| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | *standing to attention* I understand. Quick, can anyone spot tracks to the barrels? Could this be a monstar trap? |

And with that thought, a blue streak circles you first slowly and then quicker and quicker raising you up into the air.  You feel energy and you feel better.  You gain 6 HP as you slowly lower back to earth.<br /><br />YOU HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF.<br /><br />The bandit looks at you terrified.  "R...R....R...REACHER!"  He bolts away from you, back from where he came. You look at Nelly and he is astonished and quite scared himself.  <br /><br />Cat, you are up. |

Any man would fall from your attack. <br /><br /><br />Unless he was 30 feet away and running away. As is this bandit. He disappears into the woods. <br /><br /><br />Nelly, is standing on the front of the wagon. <br /><br />"What. The. Fuck. If I hadn't raised you from the deadd myself I'd swear you were Reachers.  Did you see his face?!  He shit himself! Ha ha ha."<br /><br />Nelly motions for you all to return to the wagon. <br /><br />"I'm sure glad I'm with you guys. I have a feeling we are going to change the world."<br /><br />You all join him back on the wagon and ride on towards the radio tower. |

I'm the youngest in my family...or at least I was.  I had two older brothers.  They were both killed by Landers.  My dad died a bit later of natural causes.  But he was never the same after the death of my brothers.  I think I'm probably the only thing keeping my mom alive at this point.  If I'm not around to take care of her, I don't know what would happen.  And her taking care of me gives her purpose."<br /><br />"That situation with the bandits could have gotten hairy, but you guys were great.  And that thing you did?  That was wild.  I've only seen Reachers do stuff like that.  They're like the higher ups of the Landers. They have all sorts of magical abilities. I'm not sure how you guys did that, but if you could keep it up, that would be great."<br /><br />At that time you arrive at the old radio tower.  There is a large warehouse type building at the base of the tower covered in vines and overgrowth.  The entire thing is fenced in with an old rickety chain link fence.<br /><br />"Well, we're here."<br /><br />Just then, you hear a loud bang come from within the warehouse.  As if someone dropped something.  <br /><br />"Someone's in there. Maybe we should figure out a way in."<br /><br />The warehouse is shaped like a T.  And you are at the bottom of the T.  There is a door directly ahead that appears partially propped open.  To the right, there is a door that is chained shut. |

You're not an expert, but you've seen Jurassic Park.  There seem to be some power generators in here, but most of it seems like the kind of stuff that would be used to route the radio signals to the proper place.  None of it seems to be on and it looks like it hasn't been on for quite some time.  <br /><br />Something catches your eye and you bend down to look.  You reach through the fence and grab it.  It's a key. |

He puts the key in the lock and after some jiggling, it opens.  DS removes the chains and opens the door.  <br /><br />When you peak in, you see a small balcony and railing.  To the right is a small ladder that climbs down to the first floor.  When you look over the railing, you see 3 men beating a 4th man. The 3 men look very large and shabby looking.

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | Hmmm.  We have three bards so we could've all cast 'Charm Person' and stopped the fight altogether, but it's too late for that now.  <br /><br />The man on the ground isn't in the initiative order and the other three men are listed as bandits... but there are good bandits out there, so nothing is certain yet.  We likely need to fight them, but there's no need to rush things especially since we outnumber them and have the high ground.  Fortunately, we're all early enough in the initiative order that we can get into position with 'ready' actions and still do this right.  <br /><br />So I'm going to use my 30ft of movement to get down the ladder (so I'm not blocking others on the balcony) and then take position in the closest corner where I'm not behind Homer (i.e. I want to be to his left or right so that I have a full view of everyone on the ground).  Now, I don't know how big this room is, so I don't know which weapon is appropriate.  To be conservative, I'll wield my rapier but cast a spell.<br /><br />##Move: to corner as described above<br />##Communication: yell "STOP!"<br />##Ready: cast 'Vicious Mockery' on the first person within range who attacks me, one of my teammates, or the man on the ground<br />##Bonus: none |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Okay, Juvenal has moved down the ladder and to the right and about 5 feet behind Homer.  <br /><br />gingerbardman (Is this Darkus) is up. |

You slowly open your right hand down by your side.  Your rage fills your hand until it pours out to the floor in a blue electric glow, forming  a thorned whip.  Nelly looks at your hand in amazement.  You raise your hand above your hand and whip down to the men below you, striking the middle one in the face.  He screams in pain and falls onto his back.  As he removes his hand from his face, you can see that you have melted a path down his face and burned his left eye black.  The two larger men look up at you.<br /><br />"Ho. Ly. Shit."  - Nelly. |

You drive it into the crotch of the bandit driving all the way through...his pants.  Thank God for drop crotches.  The large man let's out a half tooth-missing smile.  He picks you up by the scruff of your shirt and slams you down on the ground doing 8 damage.  <br /><br />The smaller man that Jwill whipped cries out, "Take care of these idiots!" and then runs down a set of stairs.  The other larger man goes to stomp the now prone Homer, but he rolls out of the way and to safety.  <br /><br />Lil' Juvenal is up. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Lil' Juvenal looks at the bandit who threw down Homer and says, "Hey buddy!  Your head is too big for your body."  The bandit wonders if it is an insult or an observation.  He puts his hand on his head, but pretends to scratch his head feeling the size of it.  He doesn't want you to know you're in his head. But you are.  His anguish causes him to lose 2 HP and be distracted. <br /><br />The man who was being beaten says, "Thanks guys, I'm going to go get that coward!" and runs after the man down the stairs.  <br /><br />Jwill is up. |

He looks down to realize you have cut a little "J" into his shirt.  <br /><br />Jwill you are up.  If you submit an action, please submit your rolls for that action as well.

| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | Cast rhunderwave. 22 with mod.<br /><br />A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.<br /><br />In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet |

Everyone else flies back 10 feet away from Jwill. The bandit who slammed Homer blows back hard and his head hits the concrete.  Blood starts flowing from the back of his head.  The other bandit took quite a fall as well.  He sees his deadd partner and starts talking.<br /><br />"Guys, I don't know who you are or what you want, but we CANNOT let that guy escape.  He's going to kill a lot of people if we don't stop him.  Please guys.

He looks at Nelly who is worse for wear and also cowering away from him. <br /><br />And then he remembers his healing kit. As he reaches down the gravity of what he's done starts to hit him. As he rummages through his kit, he's almost overwhelmed.  A brite white ring begins to eminate from him like a ring of water after a rock is thrown into a pond. As it reaches each person, they gain 8 HP. <br /><br />"The bandit looks at Jwill. Th-thank you. I wasn't doing to well. Does that mean you guy will help?"<br /><br />The rest of you begin to rustle and get back to your feet. <br /><br />Nelly looks more at ease. |

You should come live there instead of out in the wild like this.  It's called Corona.  My team was sent here on a mission to scout this radio tower for parts.  That's when we saw that bandit here.  Our captain, the guy you whipped across the face, found him messing with something and asked him about it.  The guy said it was some sort of bomb from the aliens.  And he was going to use it to blow up one of their outposts.  He told us the location, and we told him there was no outpost there and our town was too close to set it off. <br /><br />An argument ensued and he insisted that he didn't care as long as he got to blow up their outpost.  He tried to leave with the bomb and that's when we tried to stop him.  A fight broke out and then you guys showed up.  <br /><br />Listen guys, we don't know how big that bomb is.  If he sets it off anywhere near Corona, that town will be devastated.  My friends.  My family. Everyone I've ever know.  Please. Help me. |

You follow him down the stairs that both the Captain and the man being beaten ran down.  Once you get to the bottom you see the Captain on his knees next to a large pit that seems to have formed when part of the station collapsed.  The man who as being beaten has a crossbow aimed at his chest.<br /><br />The man you followed down yells, "NO!"  <br /><br />They both look at you and the captain yells, "Stay back!"

You grab his wrist with your right hand and the edge of the pit with your left.  You can't tell if he's deadd or just unconscious, but he has an arrow sticking out of his chest.  You look up to see the crossbow in your face.  <br /><br />The man with the crossbow yells, "SHALL WE MAKE IT 2 FOR 1?"  The man with you shouts again.  "Please, everyone stop!

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for your grip on the ledge.  Everyone else is too far away to help, so you do the only logical thing and drop the deadd Captain and grab the ledge with your right hand.  And just as you do, you hear a loud boom followed by bright lights.  And then you hear a familiar voice.<br /><br />"HEY GUYS, I GOT IT WORKING!"<br /><br />You look up to a mezzanine above you and there stands Nelly.

| ![Homer](https://i.imgur.com/N2VsADDb.png)<br>Homer | coolness > the linear progression of time |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | In that case, we're suddenly back at the cart and I use my movement to get in rapier range this time |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Jwill runs to Thunderwave him, but he is out of range and disappearing in a hurry.  Just then, a loud rumbling overhead interrupts.  Just then you see your cart and horses jump from above the bay door that Jwill stands at and that the bandit left through.  There is a loud neigh as the cart starts to descend in slow motion.  It bangs to the ground and then Tokyo drifts sideways to reveal Lil' Juvenal at the wheel.  He must have snuck back out in the commotion.  <br /><br />"I live my life a quarter mile at a time.  Get in boys."<br /><br />Lil' Juvenal, choose a pace.  <br /><br />Grueling<br />Strenuous<br />Steady |

The horses are fast and the cart is light.  It's not long until the now whirling radio antennae is out of your sights.  You can see signs of where the bandit's cart has come through.  You look down to see the big guy whom you initially attacked is in tears.  <br /><br />"There he is!" shouts Nelly<br /><br />You look up and see the dust from his cart.  Lil' Juvenal is going straight Intimidater on this cart.  Before you know it you are within 10 feet of his cart.  He has seen you and has kicked it into high gear.  You are running at the same pace now.<br /><br /><br />Roll for initiative. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Homer, leaps from the cart and lands on the bandit's cart.  Just then the bandit hits a bump and Homer falls.  He grabs at the cart, but grabs the blanket covering most of the cart.  It slips off and Homer is thrown from the cart.  With the blanket removed you can see the large bomb that the bandit is carrying.  Homer is wrapped up in a blanket and lands with a hard thud and takes 1 damage. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | The bandit hears the commotion and turns around.  He has finally noticed you.  He pulls up a crossbow from beneath his feet and aims it at Lil' Juvenal.  His horses swerve and he misses wildly.  <br /><br />"Oh my God! Look!" cries Nelly.  "It's another town!  There are more of us!"<br /><br />You look ahead and you can see buildings ahead.  A small town starts to appear in the distance.<br /><br />Juvenal, you're up. |

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | How about we spook those horses and see if we can flip the cart.  I'll cast a Minor Illusion of, say... a bunch of hissing snakes, just ahead and to the side of one horse so that it rears up and twists the harness.  At these speeds, that might be enough?<br /><br />Minor Illusion is a cantrip, so I don't need to roll for it, right?  I'll also use my move action (if necessary) to get in the perfect spot before casting it. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | As soon as that thought pops into your head, a large entanglement of vipers appears just in front and to the side of the horses.  They see the snakes and freak the fuck out.  They veer wildly to the right and cut you off.  The bandit runs into the ditch and ramp up out the other side.  It is violent and the bandit tries to correct course, but ends up over correcting.  The horses veer back into the ditch and launch the cart once again into the air and down with a crash.  <br /><br />The horses are running full speed, but since they are zig zagging all over the place, you can easily keep up, but you keep your distance for safety.  The horses are pulling in opposing directions, and then one overpowers the other and the zoom off into a direction full speed.  The bandit is trying his best to get control of the situation, but to no avail.  There is dust flying everywhere and sometimes the cart is up on two wheels.  <br /><br />And that's when the bandit notices it.  There is a vendor on the side of the road.  He has a cart full of old kitchen appliances.  He is trying to load a refrigerator from like the 1950s onto his cart and he sees these horses running full speed at him.  The bandit pulls hard back on the reigns to stop the horse, and the man jumps out of the way just as the horses crash into his cart.  The cart upends head over feet flying over the appliances as they shoot into the air as well.  A giant dust ball forms as you hear horses wailing and moving.  The appliance vendor is covered in dust and crawling away.  You are close to the town now and people are jogging in your direction as they've heard the commotion.<br /><br />As the dust settles, you see the bandit standing.  He is scraped up and bloodied.  <br /><br />Jwill, you're up. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Jwill casts a wave of thunder that pushes forth from him knocking the bandit back into the cart and sending it all flying along with several refrigerators.  At this time, most of the townspeople have reached you and stop abruptly.  They've never seen anything like this.  As the dust settles the bandit is on the ground coughing up blood.  He slowly stands up, and he's holding a detonator.  <br /><br />"No one move!"  he shouts.  But he is in bad shape.  Barely holding on to life.  And then, quickly, and silently.  An arrow punctures his chest.  You look behind you to see the large man who was with "The Captain" with a crossbow.  His eyes are filled with tears.  <br /><br />"You son of a bitch."<br /><br />The bandits eyes are wide.  His mouth is agape.  And his thumb.  Is depressed.  He falls to the ground deadd.<br /><br />"THE BOMB!" shouts Nelly.<br /><br />You can hear a beeping sound coming from the bomb.  Through the dust, you see the number 10.  Then 9.<br /><br />"Hurry!  Get into the refrigerators. They should shield us from the blast, like president Jones."<br /><br />Nelly runs and jumps into a refrigerator and closes the door.<br /><br /><br />8. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Lil' Juvenal shoves everyone in the party into refrigerators before jumping into one himself.  The last thing he sees before he closes the door is the face of the big man who shot the bandit.  His eyes are still filled with tears.  He either has no idea what he's done or he doesn't care.  He turns his head and looks at Lil' Juvenal and lets out a cry of pain and anguish.  <br /><br />The door shuts.<br /><br />2. <br /><br />1.<br /><br />You all hear a loud boom and then you can feel yourself flying through the air and crashing into the ground.  You roll over and over again in the refrigerator.  You are banged up and flying everywhere.  And then.  It stops.  It's quiet.  You open the door.<br /><br />All you can see is black.  The ground is black. There is ash everywhere.  You see the ash remains of people.  Just moments ago alive.  You see the large man.  His mouth open, wailing.  You see children shielding their eyes.  You see young couples wrapped in each other's arms.  Holding tight, trying to escape the inevitable.  Mothers holding infants.  You see your horses frozen in terror.  Husbands trying to protect families.  All for naught.  They are all gone.  Frozen in time.<br /><br />"It's a long walk back to town.  We better get going."<br /><br />Nelly shuffles up the road.  Naive no more.   He has seen death on a scale most will never see.  He stares off as he walks.  You follow, giving him distance.  Not knowing what to say.  It's getting dark now.  <br /><br /><br />0. |
