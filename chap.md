| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Your hands are black.  And they smell....amazing.  You haven't been this excited in a long time.  Your hands have been covered with gunpowder for years now.  But not like this. You've got enough pyrotechnics for this show that you had to get permits you didn't even know existed before.  You're probably on a list now. But fuck it.  This time it means something.  This time it'll be remembered.  This show. This time. This place.<br /><br />An inspector walks up.<br /><br />"How are the safety checks?" |

| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | Safety checks are all complete! Ready to rock and roll |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | "Good, good, good."  <br /><br />Just initial here, here and sign here.<br /><br />He hands you a clipboard with a checklist on it.  He points to the places you need to sign.<br /><br />"What the fuck?!" The inspector dives out of the way.<br /><br />You turn around.  There is a weird man holding one of the pyrotechnic devices used for the show.  He is pointing it at you.  It fires off.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Roll for a dexterity check. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | This fool has decided to attack you with the one thing you are a master at.  Flying projectiles. <br /><br />Without even thinking you dodge out of the way and snatch the projectile out of the air.  Saving yourself and everyone behind you.  <br /><br />With one continuous motion, you throw the projectile into the air and it explodes 20 feet above your head in a gold burst.  It rains down gold sparks around you as you walk like a badass over to the strange man.  This sets off the overhead sprinklers as well.  Your footsteps fall into puddles and the sparks sizzle once they reach the ground.  <br /><br />"What the fuck is your problem?"<br /><br />The man looks unnerved.  He wasn't expecting such a grand display.  He backs up and bumps into a table lined with speakers.  Feeling boxed in, he does the only thing he knows to do.  He prepares for a fight.  <br /><br />Roll for initiative. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | The man shakes an item in his hand and out flips a weapon that looks like a blade. He rushes at you and swings his blade at your throat. <br /><br />You matrix style dodge it and push him back.  His is off balance. <br /><br />Your move. |
| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | What kinds of abilities do I have? Do you have a link to a sorcerer player card? |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You have no special abilities at this time. |
| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | So just my fists or what? |
| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | ##back up to the other people behind me <br /><br />"If you're looking for a fight you came to the wrong place buckaroo" |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | I think you still have your clipboard.  But other than that, you are weaponless. |
| ![Chap](https://i.imgur.com/Sjpt3Kbb.png)<br>Chap | I still want to retreat as said earlier |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You back up but just as you try to do so something almost invisible comes out of the man's chest and grabs you.  You can see it, but only barely.  You can see the movement of the air.   You are attached to the weird man. You cannot move.  He raises his right hand to the sky and clouds begin to form.  And it gets cold.  Real cold.  Everyone around you turns blue.  Then freezes solid. You also suffer this fate.  Frozen in your own body, you see the cold starts to work it's way up the invisible force holding you to the man.  <br /><br />His eyes look panicked as he sees the same thing.  He concentrates and an electricity comes from his body and through the invisible force.  It stops the freezing and pushes it back towards you.  It enters your body.  You feel power like you've never felt before.  You melt.  You feel amazing.  Too amazing.  Your body cannot hold this power.  The blood rushes to your head.  You cannot breathe.  You grasp at your throat.  The light fades from your eyes.  You drop to your knees.  The world goes black.<br /><br />YOU HAVE DIED.<br /><br />Please stay tuned for Chapter 1 |
