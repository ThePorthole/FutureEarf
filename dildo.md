Only a little.  And maybe more excited than nervous.  But either way, it takes you back to the younger days.  When you were first starting out.  The hopes and dreams you had. And now. Well now, they're coming true.  You are about to do something really big.  You could never have dreamed of this moment.  <br /><br />One of the guys walks up to you.<br /><br />"Hey man, there's  a weird guy here who said he went to school with you.  Come on man!  Let's get him high!" |

Shit, there's your boy."<br /><br />He points at a very tall strange looking man walking towards you. But this guy doesn't seem like the type of guy who wants to get high.  He is aggressively shoving people out of the way.  His arms are freakishly long and don't quite look right, but they are swole af.  He looks at you and lets out a high pitched scream that hurts it's so loud.  You cover your ears.<br /><br /><br />Roll for initiative. |

| ![Dildo Baggins](https://i.imgur.com/Z6MpsHdb.png)<br>Dildo Baggins | I throw my friend towards the scurry gai and then run into a crowd of people trying to blend in |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You notice the aggression and this dude is harshing your mellow.  You are out.  You grab your friend and throw him at the strange man and sprint into the crowd.  The man quickly grabs your friend and throws him into the air. He falls about 15 feet away.  You see him land on his head and blood go everywhere.  His arms are clearly broken and in weird angles. The last thing you see of him is the handmade Lite Brite watch you made him for his recent birthday.  <br /><br />You move throughout the crowd.  You've slowed down now as to blend in, but there is movement and panic in the crowd now as your friend's deadd body is found.  Then you feel it.  It's like someone has grabbed your chest.  You can almost see something, but it's a mostly invisible.  It looks like the Predator when it's invisible yo!  And then there's a boom.  Like a bomb went off. And everyone around you flies away from the explosion.  But you are held into place by the force.  And then you see him.  The other end of this almost invisible force is the strange man.  You are held to him.  <br /><br />He makes raises his hand and you feel a stab. And then another. Thorn like things are coming up all through your flesh.  You have never felts pain like this.  And you are terrified.  You are bleeding profusely.  You are immobilized.  <br /><br /><br /><br />As you sit immobilized you move your eyes to see the thorns starts to work it's way up the invisible force holding you to the man.<br /><br />His eyes look panicked as he sees the same thing. He concentrates and an electricity comes from his body and through the invisible force. It stops the thorns and pushes it back towards you. It enters your body. You feel power like you've never felt before. The thorns leave your body. You feel amazing. Too amazing. Your body cannot hold this power. The blood rushes to your head. You cannot breathe. You grasp at your throat. The light fades from your eyes. You drop to your knees. The world goes black.<br /><br />YOU HAVE DIED.<br /><br />Participate in Chapter 1 |
