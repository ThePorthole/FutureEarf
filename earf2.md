The town has really started to bustle and settle into it's new capacity.  The economy has grown with the advent of new businesses and talents of the newer arrivals.  It seems like almost everyday welcomes a new person.  With the new defenses, tensions have eased and a new sense of happiness has been ushered in.  While the regular citizens aren't aware that you are responsible for much of this, but the members of the All-Stars are well aware, and you've become a bit of a minor celebrity amongst them.  They often by you drinks and seek out your company.  <br /><br />Before you visit Michael, how have you been spending the past few weeks? |

How about you lil' Juvenal?'<br /><br /><br />Lil' Juvenal stares blankly at the wall.<br /><br />"Geez I hope you guys didn't get any ill affects from radiation from that bomb."<br /><br />Anyway, this town has really grown since your last adventure.  Not only that, but we've heard tale of other towns starting to form.  I think we all thought we were the only ones, but with an event as big as the one you pulled off, and the radio signal, people seem to have hope again.  <br /><br />But it's not all good news boys.  Word is there's some sort of new creature that the Arrived have been developing.  And it ain't friendly.  Been hearing tales of it for a while now, but figured it was just guys scared out of their minds making shit up.  Then one of my generals, Rico, came back.  Shook up.  Talking about an Arrived Monster.  Huge.  Killed 6 men.  <br /><br />I just can't believe he'd be wrong about something like this.  We're gonna get you guys to Mundo.  New township popped up there.  They've evidently built like a steamboat that can take you across the Salton Sea to La Qunita where the beast is.  He's holed up in an old resort there.  <br /><br />Thing is, I don't really trust these new townships.  Everyone seems to have their own agenda.  So I'd suggest creating fake identities so no one knows who you truly are.  Might make you a target.  Either way,  head down to your buggies whenever you're ready.  I've had them prepared for you. Assuming you guys are up for the task. |
