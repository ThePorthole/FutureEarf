Why you're here.  To really make a difference.  You've finally put something together that you think will get something done.  This festival is getting a lot of attention.  And the people here are excited.  You can feel the electricity in the air.  You breathe it in.  This place is a haystack. Dry. And ready for a spark.<br /><br /><br />A knock at the door.  It opens.  One of the roadies pops his head in.<br /><br />"Hey man, there's a weird guy out here who is asking to see you.  He says you guys have a business venture together." |

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | i only venture business with weirdos, so that could be anybody.  let him in, i guess. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | The man is lead in.  And you don't recognize him.  He is weird though.  He moves very strange.  Almost like his proportions are off.  And he's tall as shit.  Like 6' 5" or something.  The roadie at the door gives you a look that lets you know he's weirded out.<br /><br />"Nice to meet you again,"  he says. |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | hey man, you look different.  your proportions off? |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | His eyes immediately widen. Like way too fukken wide.  Like, how are eyes that big?!?<br /><br />And then he opens his mouth. Wide. Way too wide.  And a blood curdling screech comes out.  It's so loud, you cover your ears.  <br /><br />The door behind him slams shut without him touching it.  And locks.  He makes an up and down motion with his hand and some sort of spear-like weapon extends out of his clinched fist.  <br /><br />Roll for initiative. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | The weird man charges you.  You steady yourself and he jumps onto the ceiling!  WTF?!<br />He then jumps down behind you.  And that's when you hear the strangest sound you've ever heard.  It was like a thud mixed with a squishy sound mixed with a cracking sound.  <br /><br />And all too quickly you realize what it was.  You look down to see the spear sticking out of your chest.  But it doesn't hurt.  It's just there.  You fall to your knees.  You can hear the muffled sound of your roadie banging on the door asking if you're okay.  You try to answer, but blood is in your throat.  You gurgle.  Or at least try before you fall to the floor.<br /><br />YOU HAVE DIED.<br /><br />Please stay tuned for Chapter 1 |
