And today's the show. You've got enough computer power here to put the NSA to shame.  Fuck 'em.  You've been working with this team for months. This means something.  This isn't just an ordinary light and visual show.  This festival is going to change the world.  And you have the grand finale ready.  People will remember this forever.  You forever.  The images. The stories that are going to be told.  You've had film crews out for over a year now.  <br /><br />You hear one of your techs say, "Fuckin' A, some shithead is climbing on the fucking lighting rig." |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | "What should we do?" He asks. |
| ![MacTear](https://i.imgur.com/BSQmgBub.png)<br>MacTear | What should we do? |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | "Shit!" your tech screams as the man releases a light that falls between you and him.  <br /><br />The man on the lighting rig is moving very weird.  And fast.  He spots you and leaps from the rig with lightning speed.  He looks at you, eyes wide and screams so loud it brings you to your knees.  He leaps the entire 50 feet from him and you in a single bound.  And lands in front of you.  From seemingly nowhere he pulls out a weapon that looks like a spear. <br /><br /><br />Roll for initiative. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | The man moves awkwardly.  His limbs seem too long.  His jaw seems very large.  He looks at with a tilted head.  And before you can blink he's upon you.  He slices at your chest cutting you deep.  You grasp your chest to hold the blood in.  He has continued on behind you.<br /><br /><br />You lose -8 HP.<br /><br /><br />Your move. |
| ![MacTear](https://i.imgur.com/BSQmgBub.png)<br>MacTear | Kick his legs out from under him. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Roll for dexterity. |
| ![MacTear](https://i.imgur.com/BSQmgBub.png)<br>MacTear | <br /><br />I hate this fucking game. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You attempt a leg sweep, but slip in the puddle of blood that has formed at your feet.  You fall flat on your face.  As you look over your right shoulder you see a boot coming down on your face.  The pain is excruciating.  You feel your jaw explode.  <br /><br />YOU HAVE DIED.<br /><br />Please stay tuned for Chapter 1 |
