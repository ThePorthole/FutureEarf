And these all-black "security" shirts aren't helping either. The opening act really has the crowd in a frenzy.  You've noticed a young girl who's been hanging out by the entrance you are guarding.  You notice that look.  She's looking for any opportunity for you to let your guard down so that she can get backstage.  You can tell she's all but given up.  But then she casually walks up to you.<br /><br />"Look, I've traveled 2,000 miles just to be here and I would really love to get backstage." |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You take off your shirt and hat. It's a bit cumbersome to do with your earpiece in. But you get it done. By the time you do, she's slipped past you and is back stage. <br /><br />At this point you notice a mosh pit has formed near you and the crowd is starting to push towards you.<br /><br />The pit is violent. People are jumping higher and higher. <br /><br />Holy shit!  One kid flies 50 feet into the air. The crowd panics and starts to stampede. People are rushing in every direction. Except one kid. A really tall kid. He's like 6'5". Lanky but muscular. He's heading right your way. <br /><br />He's tossing kids like rag dolls. He moves really weird. Like a kid who went through full on puberty overnight. But worse. Like his body is out of proportion. <br /><br />He reaches into the bag on hi back and pulls out a small object. He shakes it and it extends to a full on staff with a blade on it. <br /><br />Roll for initiative. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | You try to pull the spear out of your shoulder.  But the loss of blood has left you severely weakened.  The kid closes in on you.  He stands over and extends his right palm towards you.  You start to get warmer and warmer until you realize that you are on fire.  It is the worst pain you've ever experienced.  You squirm to try to get off the spear.  You can't breathe.  All of the oxygen is removed from what is left of you lungs.<br /><br /><br />YOU HAVE DIED.<br /><br />Please stay tuned for Chapter 1 |
