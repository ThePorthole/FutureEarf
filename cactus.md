| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | a clue!  wait, who is ben again?  one sec. |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | ah yes, good ol' Ben Rice. Just an old man and friend of Nelly |

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | and can i pls have a flute instead of a s-hawm so that i can put a poison dart in it and use it like a blowgun |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | For sure on the flute. Good to go on the whisper bard. Let me think on the race. Races might end up playing a large part in the gameplay. |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | I'm just going to assume you know all your character stats since you have the sheet.  Does that work? |

| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Pretty important. I'll keep pounding away at it so hopefully it gets kept up with. |

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | Yes, hi, I would like to level up and whatnot.  I also have my sshiny new 15gp (thanks!) but I'm not sure what to spend it on.  Most of the cool sstuff is out of my price range and I haven't even sspent my initial sstarting monies.<br /><br />Sstill want to be a yuan-ti and all that, sso hopefully that's sstill cool. |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Add your points and etc and i'll get started on the next mission . |

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | i'd still like to do the yuan-ti idea, but i have to rethink how it's going to work now that i've been reminded that we're on earth (meaning earth).  if i figure something out, i'll post it here.<br /><br />US city of origin <----- i dunno, new york city for now<br />family <----- like a last name or something?<br />etc. <----- what |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | Do you have any family, etc.  Names, relation.<br /><br />Any background beyond that? |

| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | family?  let's just say none that i know of, at least for now.<br /><br />for background, the issue is that i'm of course trying to hide the fact that i'm an evil cultist.  so i can give you a true background for your purposes, but really i almost need a cover story first |
| ![JohnnyDollar](https://i.imgur.com/0XQ6aLrb.png)<br>JohnnyDollar | True backstory and cover would be great |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | working up a backstory.  very centered on the salton sea.  ever been there?  oof.  tragic.<br /><br />also pumped to pursue the cultist angle.  i'm going to use dndbeyond to whip up a character sheet for your reference, since with darkus' content sharing there's actually a yuan-ti option.  that should help a bit. |
| ![Juvenal](https://i.imgur.com/uVPyPEpb.png)<br>Juvenal | yuan-ti purebloods and whisper bards are now official, btw<br /><br />though there are some slight differences with the UA i was using (but no longer). |
